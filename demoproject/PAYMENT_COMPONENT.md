## Component Structure

```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ PaymentCheckout.jsx    # Main component with form logic
â””â”€â”€ PaymentCheckout.css    # Comprehensive styling
```

## Usage

The component is already integrated into the main App.jsx file. To use it in other parts of your application:

```jsx
import PaymentCheckout from './components/PaymentCheckout';

function MyApp() {
  return <PaymentCheckout />;
}
```

## Form Validation

The component includes comprehensive form validation:

- Required field validation for essential payment information
- Email format validation
- Real-time error clearing when user starts typing
- Visual error states with red borders and error messages

## Customization

### Styling
Modify `PaymentCheckout.css` to customize:
- Color scheme (currently uses purple gradient theme)
- Typography and spacing
- Layout breakpoints for responsive design

### Order Items
Update the order summary section in `PaymentCheckout.jsx` to display dynamic order data:

```jsx
// Replace static items with props or state
const orderItems = [
  { name: "Premium Plan", description: "Monthly subscription", price: 29.99 },
  { name: "Setup Fee", description: "One-time charge", price: 9.99 }
];
```

### Payment Processing
The form currently logs form data to console. Integrate with your payment processor:

```jsx
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  if (validateForm()) {
    // Replace with actual payment processing
    try {
      const response = await processPayment(formData);
      // Handle success
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle payment errors
    }
  }
};
```

## Security Considerations

This is a frontend component for demonstration. For production use:

1. **Never process real payments on the frontend**
2. **Use secure payment processors** (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
3. **Implement proper backend validation**
4. **Use HTTPS for all payment forms**
5. **Follow PCI DSS compliance guidelines**

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- JavaScript ES6+ features used

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The component will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
